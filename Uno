Define cards 2-10 each with their four suits:
  Heart = 1
  Diamond = 2
  Clubs = 3
  Spades = 4
  
Define face cards as:
  Jack = switch rotation order of players until another jack is put down
  Queen = skip next player's turn
  King = next player draws 2 cards from draw pile
  Ace = next player draws 4 cards from draw pile 
  Joker = current player draws 2 cards from draw pile
  If Joker has no suit then Joker = Spades
  
Every player gets 10 cards:
  Each player puts cards in ascending xor descending order
  Rest of Cards = draw pile

Player with the youngest birthday has the first turn:
  First player puts down any card in the middle to start the playing pile
  Turn is over and the next player's turn starts

Next player's turn:
  If player has a card with a matching suit or number to the top card of the playing pile then they put it down and turn is over
  Else player takes the top card from the draw pile until they can put down a card and their turn is over
  If player has multiple cards that they can put down then they must choose only 1 card
  If there is a face card at the top of the playing pile then current player must oblige and their turn is over
  
  If player takes a Joker from the top of the draw pile then they must take additional 2 cards from the draw pile
  If draw pile empties then turn the playing pile face-down and start new playing pile with the top card of the new draw pile
  If player has one card left at the end of their turn then they must say "uno"
  Turn is over and the next player's turn starts
  
Repeat previous segment until a player has 0 cards:
  If a player has 0 cards then they win and the game is over
