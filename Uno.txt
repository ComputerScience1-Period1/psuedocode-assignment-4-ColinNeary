//if you're making uno, then wouldn't you have colors and wild cards
Shuffle deck fully

Define cards 2-10 each with their four suits:
  Heart =  suit1
  Diamond = suit2
  Clubs = suit3
  Spades = suit4
  
Define face cards as:
 Jack = switch rotation order of players until another jack is put down
 Queen = skip next turn
 King = next player draws 2 cards from draw pile
 Ace = next player draws 4 cards from draw pile 
  //joker can be a boolean depending if it has a suit or not (suit being true or false)
  //also, define Joker as boolean
  Joker == true;
  if(Joker == false){
  Joker has no suit}
  then{Joker = suit4}
  
  Define order of players:
    //doesn't really matter,make it random rock paper scissors for who goes first.
   First player = player with the oldest birthday
   Next player = player with the next oldest birthday
    Repeat until all players have been named
      //make integer carts with a value of ten
      int Cards = 10;
      p1,p2,p3,p4 = Cards
      //no need to repeat code when you can apply to all players defining how many cards they have
   Give first player 10 cards:
    Give next player 10 cards:
    Repeat until all players have 10 cards
    Player puts cards in ascending xor descending order:
      Repeat until all players have sorted thier cards
      
      Rest of Cards = draw pile deck
    
        First player puts down any card in the middle to start the playing pile:
         Turn is over and the next player's turn starts

         Next player's turn:
          If there is a face card at the top of the playing pile: 
           then current player must oblige and their turn is over
          If player has a card with a matching suit or number to the top card of the playing pile:
           then they put it down and turn is over:
          else : 
           player looks at hand if no cards are playable:
             then player takes the top card from the draw pile 
           now they can put down a card and their turn is over
          If player has multiple cards that they can put down:
           then they must choose only 1 card at random:
          If player takes a Joker from the top of the draw pile: 
           then they must take additional 2 cards from the draw pile
          If draw pile empties: 
           then turn the playing pile face-down and start new playing pile with the top card of the new draw pile:
          If player has one card left at the end of their turn: 
           then they must say "uno"
          If player does not have a card that matches the deck
            Another player can challengr
              Else is successful the player with one card left who called uno draws 4 cards
                Else is unsuccessful the player who challenged draws the 4 cards
          Turn is over and the next player's turn starts
  
           Repeat previous selection until a player has 0 cards:
             If a player has 0 cards:
                then they win:
                 else :
                  they don't win
                  Have Fun!
